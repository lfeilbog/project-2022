				<h3>Leah Feilbogen, Co-Fellow</h3>
				<img src="../images/lfeilbogen.jpg" width="200" alt="Leah Feilbogen headhsot">
				<p>
					My name is Leah and I am currently a junior at the University of Michigan, School of Information,
					studying information analysis. I have always had a personal interest in healthcare, and I am
					intrigued
					by the intersection of informatics and medical research. My involvement with the TOM program at my
					high
					school, the Leffell School (formally known as Schechter Westchester), as well as my passion for
					helping
					different communities and love for problem solving is what lead me to join the TOM community at
					Michigan. I look forward to growing the TOM community at Michigan this year by serving as a
					co-fellow
					for our chapter!
				</p>
				<h3>Aidan Friedsam, Co-Fellow</h3>
				<img src="../images/afriedsman.jpg" width="200" alt="Aidan Friedsam headhsot">
				<p>
					Aidan is a Computer Science major at the University of Michigan. After
					teaching himself to code at the age of 14, Aidan fell in love with
					programming, tinkering and creating. Aidan loved participating in
					Hackathons in high school and even helped run a Hackathon at his own high school. Last year Aidan
					participated in his first TOM Makeathon where he 3D modeled and printed a new tennis racket handle
					for a
					man who loved to play wheelchair tennis, but struggled with his grip strength. Aidan is eager to
					join
					the team at Michigan as more than just a participant where he hopes to combine his love for
					engineering
					and problem solving with his passion for giving back to the community.
				</p>
				<h3>Jacob Burstein, Need-Knower Coordinator</h3>
				<img src="../images/jburstein.jpg" width="200" alt="Jacob Burstein headhsot">
				<p>
					My name is Jacob and I am currently a sophomore at the University of Michigan, School of
					Information,
					studying philosophy politics and economics. I have always had a personal interest in innovation,
					and I am intrigued by the combination of engineering and helping others. My involvement with the TOM
					program began at my high school, the Leffell School (formally known as Schechter Westchester), where
					I was involved in many projects to benefit others and this involvement lead me to join the TOM
					community
					at Michigan. I am excited to contribute to the TOM community at Michigan this year!

					My name is Bella and I am a current junior majoring in Public Health
					Sciences and minoring in Middle Eastern Studies. I am interested in
					pursuing a career in global public health and helping developing countries establish a strong public
					health system. I have been involved in TOM since my sophomore year. I was initially drawn to TOM
					because
					I was looking for a way to help people in my community.
				</p>
				<h3>Maya Posner, Social Media and PR Coordinator</h3>
				<img src="../images/mposner.jpg" width="200" alt="Maya Posner headhsot">
				<p>
					My name is Maya Posner, and I am a junior at the University of Michigan’s School of Information,
					studying UX Design and Entrepreneurship. I have always been fascinated by how things work and have
					explored this passion by engaging in STEM-related activities. Yet, despite many creative and
					interesting
					outlets, I felt like a piece of my puzzle was missing: service for others. After learning about
					TOM’s
					mission, I knew I wanted to get involved with this incredible organization. I look forward to my
					many
					upcoming semesters in TOM at Michigan!
				</p>
				<h3>Jonah Heimowitz, Co-Treasurer</h3>
				<img src="../images/jheimowitz.jpg" width="200" alt="Jonah Heimowitz headhsot">
				<p>
					Hi! My name is Jonah Heimowitz and I am currently a sophomore at the
					University of Michigan, Ross School of Business. I am passionate about
					finding solutions to complex problems and I love all things entrepreneurial. I joined TOM because I
					saw
					how productive the Makeathons were at finding solutions for people with disabilities, and I saw how
					I
					could use my business knowledge to help the club as treasurer!
				</p>
				<h3>Eli Getz, Co-Treasurer</h3>
				<img src="../images/egetz.jpg" width="200" alt="Eli Getz headhsot">
				<p>
					My name is Eli. I am currently a junior at the University of Michigan
					studying economics with minors in business and entrepreneurship. Before I came to Michigan I was
					involved in Chai Lifeline, an organization with the goal to help families with "children battling a
					deadly disease." While TOM has a different goal, I had an immediate interested in being a part of
					the
					team due to my past in helping others in need. I am looking forward to seeing the TOM community at
					Michigan continue to grow!

				<p>
					My name is Talia and I am currently a junior at the University of Michigan in the School of
					Literature
					Science and the Arts (LSA), studying Biopsychology, Cognition, and Neuroscience (BCN). My interests
					in

					what
					led me to
					join this organization. I am excited to participate in TOM Michigan for another year! The work our
					student-led club does such as our annual makeathon is a meaningful and educational experience in
					which
					students are able to make a real impact on both our Ann Arbor community
					and globally.
