			<h2>Design Challenge</h2>
			<p>
				The TOM: Michigan Design Challenge 2021 is a social-good initiative that will support the needs of
				Need-Knowers from Friendship Circle Michigan, a local non-profit which aims to provide every individual
				with special needs the support, friendship, and inclusion that they deserve. Makers from the University
				of Michigan community will work
				independently or on teams to create prototypes that solve one of three challenges that impact the lives
				of these Need-Knowers.

					<li>Team Allie, Sensory Sensitivity</li>
					<li>
						Meet the Need-Knower: Allie is a 13 year-old girl who lives with severe ADHD. Allie loves
						reading books, Sesame Street, Peppa Pigs, and her dogs! She is sensitive around her face,
						and has trouble keeping her mask on as a result.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Challenge: To create a sensor-friendly mask, so that individuals with sensory challenges
						will enjoy wearing them and want to keep on. Why? Many of the children at Friendship Circle
						have various sensory challenges that impact their ability to comfortably wear a mask. For
						some, they don’t like the feeling of the mask on their face, others don’t like the feeling
						of their face being covered, and others don’t like the feeling of their own breath blowing
						back at them. This is dangerous, as it allows the coronavirus to spread more easily.
					</li>
					<li>
						TOM: Michigan's Solution: A 3 layered mask with cupped shape. Layers are interchangeable for
						maximum customization. Variety of patterns and ways of appealing to the wearer optioned.
					</li>

					<li>Team Hannah, Risky Running</li>


					<li>
						Meet the Need-Knower: Hannah is an 18-year-old girl who lives with down syndrome. Hannah
						loves music, singing, arts and crafts and food! Sometimes upon impulse, Hannah runs away
						from her current location, notifying no one. However, this is not only an isolated incident
						as it affects many of the children at Friendship Circle and across the world.
					</li>
					<li>
						The Challenge: To create a product that addresses the issue of children running out of their
						guardian’s sight Why? This is often scary for guardians as they often do not have a way of
						contacting Hannah or know of her whereabouts. It adds an immense amount of stress to
						caregivers and prevents them from being able to have time to themselves without worrying
						about their child. In addition, some parents fear leaving their children that engage in this
						behavior at Friendship Circle for fear that something will happen.
					</li>
					<li>
						TOM: Michigan's Solution: A tracking device attached to a waistband clip of the child with
						location information sent to a receiver belonging to the parent/guardian. This receiver will
						send the location information to the parent/guardian's cell phone to see the location of the
						child. Our device shares location information as well as warns the parent if the child
						becomes a certain distance away from the parent/guardian. <a

		<h2>TOM: Michigan Makeathon</h2>
		<p>
			Makeathons are dynamic marathons of making in which teams of Need-Knowers and Makers come together to design
			and create a solution for a neglected challenge. The outcome of the Makeathon is a working, well-documented
			prototype.
		</p>
		</br>
		<p>
			During Winter 2022 Term, The TOM: Michigan community hosted their first ever Makeathon this year, led by
			former TOM Fellow Eitan Abecassis and Current TOM Fellow Leah Feilbogen. Over the course of the weekend,
			student teams worked on two challenges.
